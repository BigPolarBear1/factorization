#### To run debug.py" (Prints the linear and quadratic coefficients to solve for 0 in the integers, for use with my paper):</br></br>

To run: python3 debug.py -keysize 12

This basically creates a system of quadratics. Solving them mod p is easy. But there is only one root solution (the factor of N) which solves the system for 0 for any mod p (aka solves it in the integers). Figuring out how to exactly do this quickly is still an ongoing area of research for me. And if a polynomial time algorithm for factorization exists, it is likely done by solving this system of quadratics. Finding a polyomial time algorithm is my ultimate goal, as this would make progress toward solving p = np as well. 

#### (Outdated, check nfs_variant instead) To run from folder "CUDA_QS_variant":</br></br>
To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run:  python3 run_qs.py -keysize 240 -base 100_000 -debug 1 -lin_size 100_000_000 -quad_size 100</br></br>

Prerequisites: </br>
-Python (tested on 3.13)</br>
-Numpy (tested on 1.26.2)</br>
-Sympy</br>
-cupy-cuda13x</br>
-cython</br>
-setuptools</br>
-h5py</br>
(please open an issues here if something doesn't work)</br></br>

Additionally cuda support must be enabled. I did this on wsl2 (easy to setup), since it gets a lot harder to access the GPU on a virtual machine.

Update: While making this PoC, I suddenly had an idea, linking back to some things I tried earlier last spring. See below (I think this approach is interesting, but its hard to get an advantage.. however using these different multiples of N.. there is a much easier way to exploit this, hence see NFS_variant):

#### To run from folder "nfs_variant" (WIP):</br></br>

Note: Experimental WORK IN PROGRESS.</br>
To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run:  python3 run_qs.py -keysize 20 -base 50 -debug 1 -lin_size 1000 -quad_size 1</br></br>

Update: Doing some more work today. I realized that I can use different quadratic coefficients as well... as long as the linear coefficient is the same. Everything else can be different. Let me see how to sieve this now.. all the math is there.. I just need to develop a proper sieving algorithm now.
