Disclaimer: At no point did AI contribute anything to this research project. Copilot can't even calculate basic congruences without making mistakes. People who think AI can do novel math research are delusional. I did not use AI for the paper, and I did not use AI for any of the code. I attacked this problem, from the very basics 3 years ago, slowly burrowing deeper and deeper. 

#### To run from folder "NFS_WIP" and "NFS_Variant_Simple" (Will be adding more NFS related code in the coming days/weeks):</br></br>

Note: Experimental WORK IN PROGRESS.</br>
To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run: python3 run_qs.py -keysize 50 -base 500 -debug 1 -lin_size 100_000 -quad_size 1</br></br>

You can run the above command from either two. NFS_Variant_Simple is an intermediate step between QS and NFS and NFS_WIP is merging all my findings into a proper NFS algorithm...

!!!NFS related code is borrowed from: https://github.com/basilegithub/General-number-field-sieve-Python (note: Very impressively written, helped me big time, thanks)

To do for NFS_WIP:

This is still a work in progress. 
Right now it can sieve quadratics similar to QS. However, what I need to do next is use the cases where we have a square quadratic coefficient (the b parameters in sieve() which is currently unused) and also sieve those, or even potentially use arbitrary quadratic coefficients and get it to work like that, but I need to sort out the math for that.. let me start by removing as much of these NFS-related approaches as I can and replace them with what I know from my own work... then after that we need to begin working to generate smooths with similar factorization and succeed at the linear algebra step much sooner... very much similar to what I tried in CUDA_QS_Variant.. but I had the realization that because we now have a much higher density of solutions per prime, this appraoch is actually feasible now.

Like, I know that "b" parameter, which is basically multiples of a polynomial i.e x^2+yx-n becomes x^2+(y\*2)\*x-n\*4 if b = 2, it basically represents the quadratic coefficient.. thats easy.. that part I know... but I'm still exploring what I can and cannot do with that knowledge.

-setuptools</br>
-h5py</br>
(please open an issues here if something doesn't work)</br></br>

Additionally cuda support must be enabled. I did this on wsl2 (easy to setup), since it gets a lot harder to access the GPU on a virtual machine.

This was an attempt at finding smooths with similar factorization using an SIQS variant. By using quadratic coefficients. But it didnt end up working as I had hoped so I abondoned this approach, but perhaps someone will get some use out of it.

#### To run debug.py" (Prints the linear and quadratic coefficients to solve for 0 in the integers, for use with my paper):</br></br>

To run: python3 debug.py -keysize 12

This basically creates a system of quadratics. Solving them mod p is easy. But there is only one root solution (the factor of N) which solves the system for 0 for any mod p (aka solves it in the integers). Figuring out how to exactly do this quickly is still an ongoing area of research for me. And if a polynomial time algorithm for factorization exists, it is likely done by solving this system of quadratics. Finding a polyomial time algorithm is my ultimate goal, as this would make progress toward solving p = np as well.
