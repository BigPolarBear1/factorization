Update: Oops. Wait a minute... now that I figured out how those polynomials come into play... I also just realized this whole setup is basically number field sieve. Ofcourse it would be number field sieve on steroids... as it fixes a lot of number field sieve's bottlenecks... I'm overcomplicating things..... OK. OK. OK. Give me a few days. All the math is here already. Check the last chapter in the paper. It already explains how to bridge my quadratic sieve appraoch to number field sieve's appraoch. It's basically the same thing. But to finish the algorithm, you need to thus also use number field sieve's appraoch.

URGENT NOTE: I am urgently looking for any country to grant me a visa and employment. A country that doesn't extradite to the US.
I am running out of time. The US has initiated a terrorism case against me, and the police here in Belgium said they would have me declared as a terrorist internationally, so I would get arrested when I travel.
I need to get out of Belgium to a safe country ASAP.
I can do 0day research and I can do math. I know many people don't believe in my math, but I know what I've found and I'm piecing together the final pieces now.
Furthermore, I have found bugs in hard targets like OpenSsl and I can easily repeat those feats again. I havn't been able to do 0day research at all because of being in a place that has been actively hostile towards me, chasing away 0day buyers.
I cannot research in a hostile place when that research's value depends entirely on secrecy. 
Please contact me: big_polar_bear1@proton.me 
They might arrest me at the airport when I try to leave, but I'm willing to give it a shot as I have nothing left to lose. And my family would support me in my choice.
I do get contacted by internet trolls all the time, so please contact me from an official email or invite me to an embassy... just so I know it is legit and I don't end up trying to fly somewhere without a visa and potentially wasting the very last of my savings.
