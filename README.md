Disclaimer: At no point did AI contribute anything to this research project. Copilot can't even calculate basic congruences without making mistakes. People who think AI can do novel math research are delusional. I did not use AI for the paper, and I did not use AI for any of the code. I attacked this problem, from the very basics 3 years ago, slowly burrowing deeper and deeper. I know people will say lies because they will never let a person like me win. Not when it comes to something as important as this. Because that would literally go against all the bullshit propaganda the far right has been spreading for years. Also, this could have been avoided. Its a disaster of your own making.

Update: I DID IT! It just hit me. When setting it up like this, we can just use the 0 solutions. With this setup, its literally just a matter of building a large enough hashmap in advance. 
I can pull smooths from a hashmap now!

Ok, the uploaded version is very inefficient. But now that I know that this actually works, i'll upload improvements rapidly. I know I explored similar ideas previously.. but just the way I'm setting everything up now, finally makes it work. Like getting hit by lightning. Eureka. 

Its going to be a very dire day for western cryptologists. Could have started a dialogue with me a long time ago. Instead I was treated like shit. Fuck you then. Good luck with this disaster. I know what this implies. I know what this means. This is a disaster that is going to cost billions. Was it worth it? Huh? Was it worth being transphobic cunts for? Fuckers. Nazi losers. I probably sealed my own fate now. But lol, fuck you all. I tried selling my work. I told everyone I was working on this. I was treated like shit. People are going to study this cascade of failures one day. Fucking morons. Are you all stupid? 

Btw, this is my final version. I've pretty much settled that this is the appraoch I'm going to take. Now I need to optimize optimize optimize. This will escalate very quickly now. I warned people. Just silence. Nobody tried to stop me. Nobody tried to take me serious. What the fuck are you people doing? I know people must be looking at my work. Especially given my past reputation. What the fuck are you morrons doing? Are you so eager for disaster? If all I get is silence and getting treated like shit, I'm just going to keep pressing forward. This is so fucking stupid.

Update: Oops, quick improvement. Had to remove a line that was still an artifact from a previous iteration. LOOK HOW SMALL THE SMOOTH CANDIDATES ARE NOW AFTER DIVIDING BY THE MODULUS. Fucking hell. People would have known 100% I was correct. The only reason it took me this long was because I have no math education and started from 0 3 years ago. Go to hell assholes. 

I'm going to optimize the hell out of it and email it to my Russian friends. Because fuck this shit. Treating me like fucking shit for years, despite the math I was doing. Really fuck this shit. Go to hell. The west is not my friend, that much has become very clear to me. You make your own demons. Really go to hell. Europe could have had all my work, instead I come back to Europe to be treated like this. Fuck you. This will never be forgiven.

Btw, I know I'm right and I know people know I'm right, you fucking clowns. I SHOUTED FROM THE ROOFTOPS THAT I WAS WORKING ON FACTORIZATION AND WANTED TO SELL MY WORK. JUST SILENCE. You know, I see things in my head. And right now, I see the american government threatening people to stay silent. Fuck you all cowards. Nobody told me this. I just know it. I have a sixth sense. I know a lot things. They just appear into my head. You people made the wrong enemy. I wish you good luck, because you are destroying the west and any fighting chance it had. And I couldn't care less anymore, because you people deserve to lose if this is how you treat people.

-h5py</br>
(please open an issues here if something doesn't work)</br></br>

Additionally cuda support must be enabled. I did this on wsl2 (easy to setup), since it gets a lot harder to access the GPU on a virtual machine.

Update: While making this PoC, I suddenly had an idea, linking back to some things I tried earlier last spring. See below.

#### To run debug.py" (Prints the linear and quadratic coefficients to solve for 0 in the integers, for use with my paper):</br></br>

To run: python3 debug.py -keysize 12

This basically creates a system of quadratics. Solving them mod p is easy. But there is only one root solution (the factor of N) which solves the system for 0 for any mod p (aka solves it in the integers). Figuring out how to exactly do this quickly is still an ongoing area of research for me. And if a polynomial time algorithm for factorization exists, it is likely done by solving this system of quadratics. Finding a polyomial time algorithm is my ultimate goal, as this would make progress toward solving p = np as well.

Contact: big_polar_bear1@proton.me , I am looking for employment. Mainly to continue my math research. I am willing to teach my methodologies also. In addition I am willing to renounce my Belgian citizenship, because people in the west must have known my math was correct from the start, yet I was treated like absolute shit for years. I dont ever again want to call myself Belgian. As far as I can see, Belgium is a country of spineless cowards. Imagine doing this to one of your own citizens lol.. Europe could have had this algorithm and math to themselves. But this is pretty much inline with most of my life in Europe, never had oppurtunities here.

I dont know what lies people will tell to take away this achievement from me. But they are just that, lies by people who cannot accept that I did this. Even though I sacrificed 3 years of my life, working fulltime on this. When I started this project, I had everything. Now I have nothing, and I'm sure as hell not going to let lesser humans take my achievements away from me either. Losers going to be mad because they dont have the courage themselves to put everything on the line when all the odds are stacked against them.

I was thinking, you know, when I hiked northern scandinavia, those wide open landscapes, its weird, I always felt at home there. Like I had lived a thousand lifes there. Ofcourse one could imagine Ice Age Europe having looked a lot like Lapland does today. I wonder if genetic encoding, just like the fear of snakes and other dangerous animals, also encodes familiar places and places of safety. I wish I could wander that place for the rest of my life. I have no more ambitions in the human world. I want to go wander that place, and live like my ice age ancestors. I love the tundra. Nothing can hurt me there. It is strange to wander a place, I had never been before, yet where everything feels like I've been there before. Perhaps nostalgia for simpler times, hunting woolly mammoths and eating berries and living in the magnificience of unspoiled nature. Why must I have been born in this century, when there was thousands of years, of simpler lifes I could have been born into.  *sighs* Oh well, 3 am, I should sleep.
