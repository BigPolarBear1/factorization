DISCLAIMER: AT NO POINT IN MY 2.5 YEARS OF RESEARCH DID I USE AI OR HAS AI IN ANY WAY HELPED WITH MY RESEARCH. I'M PUTTING THIS HERE BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE WILL ACCUSE ME OF IT.

#### To run from folder "QS_variant" (Standard SIQS with our number theory as backend):</br></br>
To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>

See below for an improved way of performing what this PoC does.. I'll delete this Proof of Concept once the PoC for Improved_QS_Variant matures a little more<br><br>
#### To run from folder "Improved_QS_Variant" (Sort of a QS/NFS hybrid that improves on Quadratic Sieve using the number theory I developped):</br></br>

I just uploaded polarbearalg_v37.py</br>
To run: python3 polarbearalg_v37.py -keysize 50</br>

I kind of implemented the basic idea in v37. I will now make a copy of the PoC in QS_Variant and modify it with these latest findings.

So the idea is that you want to generate smooths using square moduli and setting y1 to 0 (see paper)... then this generates polynomials of the shape zx^2-n, whose output is divisible by the square modulus. We only need to know the factorization of the polynomial output and variable z. But the smaller the root x is, the smaller the output of the polynomial can be made by adding the modulus to variable z. So we will need two sieve intervals, one for large values of z and the other sieve interval, is simply generated by adding the modulus to z and generating zx^2-n (but only using z values that factor over the factor base). This will vastly improve existing quadratic sieve algorithms... because even though we need two sides of the congruences factor over a factor base, these will still be vastly smaller numbers then with default QS.


People would have known. The only reason I didn't immedialty see this is because I dropped out of highschool and 2.5 years ago I didn't even know basic algebra. I swear, whoever made this decision, this deception... this betrayal even... I will find you and I will end you. Fucking morons.
