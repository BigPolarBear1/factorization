DISCLAIMER: AT NO POINT IN MY 2.5 YEARS OF RESEARCH DID I USE AI OR HAS AI IN ANY WAY HELPED WITH MY RESEARCH. I'M PUTTING THIS HERE BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE WILL ACCUSE ME OF IT.

#### To run from folder "QS_variant" (Standard SIQS with our number theory as backend):</br></br>
To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run: python3 run_qs.py -keysize 200 -base 6000 -debug 1 -lin_size 100_000 -quad_size 1</br></br>

See below for an improved way of performing what this PoC does.. I'll delete this Proof of Concept once the PoC for Improved_QS_Variant matures a little more<br><br>
#### To run from folder "NFS_Variant" (Sort of a QS/NFS hybrid that improves on Quadratic Sieve using the number theory I developped):</br></br>

I just uploaded polarbearalg_v44.py</br>
To run: python3 polarbearalg_v44.py -keysize 50</br>

UPDATE: BAH. I See it. Fuck. 

If N=4387, we can work the other way around now. Lets say we want to find the smooth 9. The easiest case to generate this is with z = 4387+9 or 4396*1^2-4387 = 9.
Now we want to find examples like this with a small z and large x. But I can precompute all this stuff super fast and query it with a hashmap. If that z is small.. then I will find a small z for any mod p. 

Yeap. AAAAAAAAAAARGHHHHHHHHH. WHY? WHY?????????????? YOU PEOPLE WOULD HAVE KONWN. BURN IN HELL FOR ALL ETERNITY FUCKERS.
