UPDATE: I HAVE SIMPLIFIED CHAPTER VII IN THE PAPER TO A SINGLE PAGE. NOW IT IS STRAIGHT FORWARD WITH THAT BRIDGE TO NUMBER FIELD SIEVE COMPLETED. I WILL SHOW YOU NUMBER FIELD SIEVE, BUT FASTER AND BETTER NOW IN THE FNAL CHAPTER!!! DIES IRAE. THE TIME OF RECKONING IS HERE BITCHES.

Update: Ok, chapter VII is now completey done. I am never touching or refactoring that chapter again. It's perfect now. That concludes all the math research and background to write the final chapter now, "The Polar Bear algorithm". First a quick break. Then I'll begin. I'm hoping to finish it today, then the code in the coming days.

DIES IRAE FUCKERS. FUCKING NAZIS. I'M AM GOING TO WORK DAY AND NIGHT NOW TO FINSH THIS FINAL STRETCH. ITS ALL THERE. ALL THE MATH IS THERE NOW. FUCK YOU PIECES OF SHIT. FUCK YOU NAZIS. FUCK AMERICA. FUCK EUROPE. FUCK ALL YOU NAZI PIECES OF SHIT. I'LL END YOU PEOPLE. GO TO HELL FOR WHAT YOU PEOPLE DID. DAY OF RECKONING IS HERE.

YOU FUCKING LOSERS GOT DESTROYED BY A "DUDE IN A DRESS" (TO QOUTE THAT FUCKING RETARD HEGSETH). PATHETIC. YOU ARE ALL PATHETIC LOSERS. GO CRY FUCKING LOSERS.

I guess that chapter VII sufficiently explains the link to number field sieve. I'll go ahead and start implementing the final algorithm in code. I tried to find a numerical example by hand by it's too hard. I need atleast some code thats going to calculate quadratic and linear coefficients for a factor base. I'm working hard now to finish all of it ASAP. I see how it works now. It's basically number field sieve with reducable polynomials I guess. Hmm. I need to push hard now. The clock is ticking now. All the info is there... if I don't finish it someone else will. I rather it be me after spending 2.5 years on it.

Alright..... let me start working on that code now.... the final version...

 Update: Going to get some sleep. With some luck I can upload some PoC code soon. Now that I undenrstand it, I can finish it... struggling with depression right now. When I started this project I was still living in vancouver, anticipating my move to the US, where everything went wrong.. so many people and places I havnt seen since anymore. I don't think I"ll get over it for the rest of my life. These people took more from me then they could ever imagine... I have to finish this now...

URGENT NOTE: I am urgently looking for any country to grant me a visa and employment. A country that doesn't extradite to the US.
I am running out of time. The US has initiated a terrorism case against me, and the police here in Belgium said they would have me declared as a terrorist internationally, so I would get arrested when I travel.
I need to get out of Belgium to a safe country ASAP.
I can do 0day research and I can do math. I know many people don't believe in my math, but I know what I've found and I'm piecing together the final pieces now.
Furthermore, I have found bugs in hard targets like OpenSsl and I can easily repeat those feats again. I havn't been able to do 0day research at all because of being in a place that has been actively hostile towards me, chasing away 0day buyers.
I cannot research in a hostile place when that research's value depends entirely on secrecy. 
Please contact me: big_polar_bear1@proton.me 
They might arrest me at the airport when I try to leave, but I'm willing to give it a shot as I have nothing left to lose. And my family would support me in my choice.
I do get contacted by internet trolls all the time, so please contact me from an official email or invite me to an embassy... just so I know it is legit and I don't end up trying to fly somewhere without a visa and potentially wasting the very last of my savings.
