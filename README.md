DISCLAIMER: AT NO POINT IN MY 2.5 YEARS OF RESEARCH DID I USE AI OR HAS AI IN ANY WAY HELPED WITH MY RESEARCH. I'M PUTTING THIS HERE BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE WILL ACCUSE ME OF IT. 

Note: Remember, as this now comes to completion in the coming days. Both the FBI and Microsoft knew I was working on factorization when I had only been working on it for a few months and nobody else in the entire world knew I was working on it. I tried desperately to avoid the path of public disclosure as I would have much rather sold my work. But at every turn people made it impossible. This would not have happened 10 years ago. An oppurtunity presented itself, it was literally handed to you on a silver platter.. and instead you people all treated me like shit and gambled on me failing with my project. I ask you, where has your common sense gone? I hate what this will do to everyone around me, this is never what I wanted. PS: I know Microsoft's PR teams will say a lot of awful shit about me, completely lacking of context, because that is just the type of people they are. If you want to know who I really am, I suggest you talk to my former teamlead and my former manager who Microsoft retaliated against for defending me. I'm done with this entire shit industry. Everything that happened, you should think whose fault this really is. Maybe instead of morrons sitting on golden thrones build with big tech money, pointing fingers at everyone whose skills and drive hurt their fragile little egoes.. maybe start using your brains, because you people keep losing and keep making things worse.

Note: I am antifa, leader of the cipherpunk, fuck the FBI department. 

#### To run from folder "QS_variant" (Standard SIQS with our number theory as backend):</br></br>
To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run: python3 run_qs.py -keysize 160  -base 4000 -debug 1 -lin_size 100_000 -quad_size 100</br></br>

See below for an improved way of performing what this PoC does.. I'll delete this Proof of Concept once the PoC for Improved_QS_Variant matures a little more<br><br>
#### To run from folder "Improved_QS_Variant" (Implements more of my number theory and attempts to succeed with fewer smooths by using p-adic lifting):</br></br>

To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run: python3 run_qs.py -keysize 140  -base 4000 -debug 1 -lin_size 1_000_000 -quad_size 10</br></br>

UPDATE: Reworking some of the high level logic in Improved_QS_Variant today..

UPDATE: AAAAAAAAAAAAARGH. So the way you do this is you have to figure out at what quadratic coefficients these large squares (even exponents) cluster together. I'll have to do a bunch of refactoring bleh.
