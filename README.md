Update: Updated the paper now. So instead of doing calculations mod (N, p) we now do calculations mod (m, p), where m is the original smooth. I think I'll end the day now and watch some movies... then tomorrow do a full numerical example. This should fix the error I made yesterday and earlier today and allow us to succesfully p-adically lift now... I'm having very high stress levels. This will work. I know it will. And its insane that people completely ignore my work considering what is at stake. So lets get that numerical example done tomorrow I guess... that should have cleared the last roadblock... and then the code... and then judgement day. I guess. It's weird how it feels like the entire universe these last couple of years has conspired to force my hand to do this, and to do it in a way it ends up with full public disclosure.. because its nothing something I would have preferred... yet here we are.... as we enter the last couple of days now before all hell breaks loose. Oh well. Sometimes, the currents of fate are too strong, and all we can do is surrender to them and drown. I'm definitely drowning.

@fbi hey fuckers, bottom of page 9. Check it. Show it to your cryptologists. They going to be sweating when they see that, because they know what will happen now. HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH. Come harass me again with the cops here in belgium. I'll destroy america. Dies Irae fuckers. You angered the bear, and now the bear will devour you.

Update: Oops. Wait a minute... now that I figured out how those polynomials come into play... I also just realized this whole setup is basically number field sieve. Ofcourse it would be number field sieve on steroids... as it fixes a lot of number field sieve's bottlenecks... I'm overcomplicating things..... OK. OK. OK. Give me a few days.

URGENT NOTE: I am urgently looking for any country to grant me a visa and employment. A country that doesn't extradite to the US.
I am running out of time. The US has initiated a terrorism case against me, and the police here in Belgium said they would have me declared as a terrorist internationally, so I would get arrested when I travel.
I need to get out of Belgium to a safe country ASAP.
I can do 0day research and I can do math. I know many people don't believe in my math, but I know what I've found and I'm piecing together the final pieces now.
Furthermore, I have found bugs in hard targets like OpenSsl and I can easily repeat those feats again. I havn't been able to do 0day research at all because of being in a place that has been actively hostile towards me, chasing away 0day buyers.
I cannot research in a hostile place when that research's value depends entirely on secrecy. 
Please contact me: big_polar_bear1@proton.me 
They might arrest me at the airport when I try to leave, but I'm willing to give it a shot as I have nothing left to lose. And my family would support me in my choice.
I do get contacted by internet trolls all the time, so please contact me from an official email or invite me to an embassy... just so I know it is legit and I don't end up trying to fly somewhere without a visa and potentially wasting the very last of my savings.
