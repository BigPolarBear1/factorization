Disclaimer: At no point did AI contribute anything to this research project. Copilot can't even calculate basic congruences without making mistakes. People who think AI can do novel math research are delusional. I did not use AI for the paper, and I did not use AI for any of the code. I attacked this problem, from the very basics 3 years ago, slowly burrowing deeper and deeper. I know people will say lies because they will never let a person like me win. Not when it comes to something as important as this. Because that would literally go against all the bullshit propaganda the far right has been spreading for years. Also, this could have been avoided. Its a disaster of your own making. 

#### To run debug.py" (Prints the linear and quadratic coefficients to solve for 0 in the integers, for use with my paper):</br></br>

To run: python3 debug.py -keysize 12

This basically creates a system of quadratics. Solving them mod p is easy. But there is only one root solution (the factor of N) which solves the system for 0 for any mod p (aka solves it in the integers). Figuring out how to exactly do this quickly is still an ongoing area of research for me. And if a polynomial time algorithm for factorization exists, it is likely done by solving this system of quadratics. Finding a polyomial time algorithm is my ultimate goal, as this would make progress toward solving p = np as well. 

#### (Outdated, check nfs_variant instead) To run from folder "CUDA_QS_variant":</br></br>
To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run:  python3 run_qs.py -keysize 240 -base 100_000 -debug 1 -lin_size 100_000_000 -quad_size 100</br></br>

Prerequisites: </br>
-Python (tested on 3.13)</br>
-Numpy (tested on 1.26.2)</br>
-Sympy</br>
-cupy-cuda13x</br>
-cython</br>
-setuptools</br>
-h5py</br>
(please open an issues here if something doesn't work)</br></br>

Additionally cuda support must be enabled. I did this on wsl2 (easy to setup), since it gets a lot harder to access the GPU on a virtual machine.

Update: While making this PoC, I suddenly had an idea, linking back to some things I tried earlier last spring. See below (I think this approach is interesting, but its hard to get an advantage.. however using these different multiples of N.. there is a much easier way to exploit this, hence see NFS_variant):

#### To run from folder "nfs_variant" (note: I'll rename this folder eventually, its really just improved way of sieving using quadratic polynomials):</br></br>

Note: Experimental WORK IN PROGRESS.</br>
To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run:  python3 run_qs.py -keysize 30 -base 50 -debug 1 -lin_size 100 -quad_size 100</br></br>

I will implement proper sieving in the coming days and prepare the paper for release. This is my breakthrough. It finally happened. This setup will allow for much better sieving. You will see in the coming days...

Contact: big_polar_bear1@proton.me , I am looking for employment. Mainly to continue my math research. I am willing to teach my methodologies also. In addition I am willing to renounce my Belgian citizenship, because people in the west must have known my math was correct from the start, yet I was treated like absolute shit for years. I dont ever again want to call myself Belgian. As far as I can see, Belgium is a country of spineless cowards. Imagine doing this to one of your own citizens lol.. Europe could have had this algorithm and math to themselves. But this is pretty much inline with most of my life in Europe, never had oppurtunities here.

I dont know what lies people will tell to take away this achievement from me. But they are just that, lies by people who cannot accept that I did this. Even though I sacrificed 3 years of my life, working fulltime on this. They will tell lies, they wont ever let a transgender person win, let alone one who dropped out of highschool. Its lies by lesser men (and women), who lack ambition and perseverance themselves. I did this. I did this through sacrifice most people cannot imagine. I gave everything for this and I have nothing left. And I piss on everyone who will attempt to deny me what I've achieved, you pathetic weaklings. And I know people will tell lies. Because people must have known I was right about my math for over a year now, and the fact that nobody reached out, tried to stop me, help me get employment.. whatever.. I can only deduce one thing from that.. and its that people really cannot accept in their minds that I did this. But I did and history will know.

And yes, I suspected already since march 2025, when I released my first QS-like algorithm utilizing my work that people knew I was correct because I saw a huge spike in traffic. Thats SIGINT 101, and thats not my fault and either way, if people knew back then that my work was correct, then someone should have spoken out instead of just endless silence and treating me like this. Go to hell. I want to work in China at this point, I am disgusted by the west.
