UPDATE: I have explained the full algorithm now in the paper. The only thing left missing is a numerical example run through at the bottom. But the math I describe works, I've checked that already. It's very similar to how number field sieve takes a square root over polynomial rings and uses p-adic lifting.

This should solve the factorization problem.... this end tomorrow. You people you should have just respected me. You ruined my life and left me completely hopeless and in despair for 2 years, seperated from all my friends that I had previously known. What did you expect was going to happen? It's over.... tomorrow the paper will be finished fo sure... that numerical example is easy, I've already got some code for that. And somewhere in the coming week the PoC will drop... and it will mean the end of the factorization problem. I hope you are all happy. Must be really proud of yourselves for what you people did. Like I didn't see what you people were doing. I will find my way to China for this disrespect. Just because I do math, doesn't mean I'm a pushover nerd, I have my pride, and all I see you people in the west do is cry about trans folks while treating me like shit. You made the choice for me.

URGENT NOTE: I am urgently looking for any country to grant me a visa and employment. A country that doesn't extradite to the US.
I am running out of time. The US has initiated a terrorism case against me, and the police here in Belgium said they would have me declared as a terrorist internationally, so I would get arrested when I travel.
I need to get out of Belgium to a safe country ASAP.
I can do 0day research and I can do math. I know many people don't believe in my math, but I know what I've found and I'm piecing together the final pieces now.
Furthermore, I have found bugs in hard targets like OpenSsl and I can easily repeat those feats again. I havn't been able to do 0day research at all because of being in a place that has been actively hostile towards me, chasing away 0day buyers.
I cannot research in a hostile place when that research's value depends entirely on secrecy. 
Please contact me: big_polar_bear1@proton.me 
They might arrest me at the airport when I try to leave, but I'm willing to give it a shot as I have nothing left to lose. And my family would support me in my choice.
I do get contacted by internet trolls all the time, so please contact me from an official email or invite me to an embassy... just so I know it is legit and I don't end up trying to fly somewhere without a visa and potentially wasting the very last of my savings.
