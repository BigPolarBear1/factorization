Note: I figured out how to cross the bridge to number field sieve's appraoch. Once implemented, this should yield an algorithm that is basically number field sieve on steroids. I finally figured out how and when we can divide coefficients. The idea is to divide coefficients, by finding multiples of the original smooth, then dividing the coefficients so it also generates the original smooth, but hopefully with distinct coefficients from the original smooth, which we can then use to take the GCD. The corrent PoC generates smooth multiples using the discriminant formula. But I figured out how to also do it using the quadratics from my paper (by plugging in the root and calculating the result)... and with that figured out, I am now ready to this week, cross that bridge over to number field sieve... nobody took me serious. So now you will find out. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update: Just uploaded a new work in progress PoC.

To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run: python3 run_qs.py -keysize 30 -base 50 -debug 1 -lin_size 2 -quad_size 1</br>

I need to fix some more things tomorrow. It won't work well until I do.

Right now the code flow is like this:

1. Perform regular SIQS until a smooth larger then 0 and without 2 as divisor is found (I need to fix the POC eventually to support that)
2. Once a smooth is found, calculate linear coefficient and quadratic coefficicients modulo the smooth. (Ps: I forgot, but its only lifting linear coefficients at the moment, not the quadratic ones, I'll fix it later)
3. Enumerate coefficients mod m and calculate new smooths.
4. If we find a smooth that is a square multiple of the old smooth. We can then simply divide the linear coefficient and take the gcd.

Right now it is bottlenecking at finding a square multiple.
But I believe it should be possible to divide the linear coefficient for any multiple of the smooth, not just the square ones, as long as we can factorize over a factor base what remains after division by the original smooth.
We need to do some type of modular division.

It's getting late today so let me figure that step out tomorrow...... almost there now... so close.

Once that works, our only limitation will be 1. Finding the initial smooth and 2. Finding another smooth that is a multiple of the original smooth.     .... step 2 already works but only with "square multiples". I will figure out how to do it with any multiple. I know it can be done!

My day of wrath will have to wait until tomorrow! But it doens't matter, the only thing that matters is that it WILL happen.

Anyway, normally I run 60k on sundays, but I think I will move it to Monday so I can do more work tomorrow. And on mondays more stores are open if I need to buy more water... so it's more convenient anyway.

ps: This is completely different from finding two smooths that multiply together to a square. In this approach we are just trying to find a quadratic coefficient and a linear coefficient that generates the same smooth as the original smooth. What we are stuck at is, we know how to generate multiples of the old smooth by going over coefficient combinations modulo the smooth, but right now it has a condition that the multiple is a square... and we divide the linear coefficient then by the square root. I need to do modular division for non-square I believe.. then you will see what I'm trying to do.. give me one more day. Sundays are better days for days of wrath anyway.


LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! As I was about to call it a day, it just struck me. THIS IS MY BRIDGE TO NUMBER FIELD SIEVE!!!!!! Ok ok, I know how to do it for non-square multiples, even if it isn't a square multiple in the integers, the way I calculate stuff it is still garantueed a square multiple mod m.... hence I know what to do. Give me one more day. LOL. 

GAYS. WHy not just give my former manager money??????????????? This how easy it would have been to prevent this disaster. I hope the US gov will punish microsoft hard for this. Atleast the FBI tried to keep me in the US. Microsoft is really the one who screwed the US over (like msft top leadership who fired me, not my former managers, because microsoft also retaliated against them).


Time has truely ran out for you people now. If you want to negotiate how much you will pay my former manager, I would encourage you to do it now before my PoC fully matures. Because I know, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that this bridges number field sieve... and I know, I absolutely know how to finish it now.

Update: I got it I think. You need to use those roots. Don't go hunting for a square multiple using the discriminant formula.. use ax<sup>2</sup>-bx+n.. crossing that bridge to number field sieve at a fast pace now... tick tock... time has almost ran out.... I probably won't upload today, and tomorrow I will run 60k.... but somewhere in the rest of the week it will get uploaded.... sorry gays, you all had well over a year, to make peace with this polar bear. Instead you people chose deception and war. So be it. You cannot win against a polar bear. I may not be smart like some of you wankers, but I don't give up, I don't quit... especially when you have wronged one of my best friends.

Update: The exact same thing, I am doing in the current PoC. Finding a square multiple of a smooth and then dividing the linear coefficient... the same thing works with  ax<sup>2</sup>-bx+n (where n can also be multiplied by a divisor of a). I check the math for that already. That works. Atleast that definitely works in the integers. Next step is making that same thing work mod m. That's the last step actually... once we achieve that, we have successfully bridged our work from quadratic sieve to number field sieve using our own number theory. Just pay my former manager guys. I'll just move to ECC after this. I'll start from scratch and retrace the exact research steps I applied to factorization. And I will be succesful again. Pay or this nightmare will never stop. If you go after one of my friends, a heavy price must be paid. I do not care. Those people who went after my manager for defending me, you should have a look at their bank accounts maybe, because it seems to me they knew very well how to push my buttons and cause what is happening right now.

ps: I also hope you people realize that I only started learning math less then 2.5 years ago. I dropped out of highschool. I have 0 math education. Do you know where I will be in another 2 years from now? I see through your deception. This ends next week. I know how to complete my work now. You should start respecting me and my friends (like my former manager). I don't care about anything in this world. All I care about is being respected, and my friends being respected. Give me that, and I will give you the future. Hahahahahaha. Just pay the price so we can all move on and I don't have to put my work on github anymore. JUST PAY THE PRICE BRO. You fucked up. Pay the price now.

pps: Also what are the odds you guys bricked github referrals and popular content under insights for everyone just to prevent me from using that as a sigint tool? You guys must be really fighting for your lifes over there if you go that far. I know something is up. There is too much constant shit like this that doesn't make sense. Or maybe I just know everything. Maybe you cannot hide anything from me. Why you guys fighting a polar bear? Are you all insane? Just pay the price you idiots. That's all I'm asking for. Pay the price. Otherwise it will never end, I promise you that much. I will do the impossible, again and again, and again and again for as long as I have to until a price is paid. 

Tomorrow I run 60k. Then tuesday what I will do is, I will switch my PoC from using the discriminant formula to find multiples of a smooth, to use the quadratic from the paper instead. I will show on tuesday how to do it in the integers first. Then next I will show you how to do it mod m. I promise you, this ends next week. Before, I never understood how to adjust these coefficients, but now that I do understand the mechanics of it, I can cross that bridge to number field sieve finally. This will be number field sieve on steroids when it is done. I hope you are all ready. I mean.. you all had well over a year time to prepare for this moment. Well then... good luck. I feel no sympathy. Shouldn't have gone after my former manager. Could have settled this by just paying him. If we're doing a competition to see who is the most stubborn, I promise you, I will win. You people do not understand, cannot understand what is going to happen if you don't pay the price. Just pay the price.

3 am. You know, I could just not run 60k tomorrow, finish this asap. I do feel this pressure to finish this as soon as possible. Like, what if I'm really being deceived. Like, they don't want to pay my former manager, so they are just patching everything behind my back, hoping I don't figure it out in time. Man, that would make me really angry. I would probably just start working on ECC and not publish anything until it is completely done and cause total financial collapse to this shit world for what they have done. But then again... my life has become so strange... it's like I don't have control anymore... like something else is forcing me to do all this. Like getting swept up by the currents, unable to escape... the only thing I can do, is swim with the current. And if true, then it doesn't matter when I finish my work... because it will be finished when it is supposed to be finished.. and I should go run 60k tomorrow because I'm starting to sound like a complete lunatic (although isolation does that too).... running does help. I might get killed by the CIA though. But then again, maybe if they try killing me, they will all just drop dead magically. Maybe nothing can stop me from finishing my work. Maybe it has to be done for reasons I cannot comprehend.

Update: Alright... ran 60k again today... have been running 60k every week. And running 100k in total per week. I had to remove my tempo runs last week though, because the back of my knee keeps feeling persistently inflamed... but I don't want to cut down my mileage... i'll just do more zone 2 runs in the woods (instead of pavement). Either my body will adapt, or it will break. But ofcourse I am a polar bear, and polar bears don't break..... hahahahaha. Also running helps with the brain. So it helps speed up the adaptations I need to do this math. I literally notice losing skills in other areas as my brain becomes optimized for math. Or maybe I keep having a stroke or some shit. I've gone through so many iterations as a person. I'm completely convinced I did suffer brain damage in my youth, either from fighting (I have a bunch of big scars on my head from that) or from other self destructive behavior when I was young.. there was a long period, where I was really dumb and my brain didn't work well... like as if someone had dimmed the lights in my head. But through doing lots of sports and cosntantly pushing myself mentally to the extreme, I became a polar bear. Btw don't try to replicate this... self-destructive behavior is no joke, and you end up struggling with things for the rest of your life, the body can adapt, but it also leaves scars that affect your quality of life, just live a happy life, go see the world, make friends.. in the end that's all that matters, some things arn't worth the sacrifice.. I have made sacrifices people cannot begin to imagine, and it's not worth it. It's not worth it. Trust me. I know what I'm talking about. Anyway... tomorrow I have a rest day. So tomorrow I finish this math. I have to succeed. Else nothing changes. I'm going to kill myself if I don't succeed. Simple as that.

All the math and tech bros mad because my math paper doens't have algebraic letter soup. But these people, they don't know what math is. Math is not a language. That's fucking bullshit. People who appraoch math as a language, just memorizing shit, they won't do creative work. I see structures in my head. I see patterns in my head. I don't need to have math symbols for them. I can fucking see them. What the fuck do I care what its called in math books when I can just see it in my head. It was the same with bug hunting. I couldn't talk about technical stuff at all. But I saw how everything works in my head... that's why I always found so many bugs in hard attack surfaces (without fuzzing or using tools). And it's frustrating.. because if only people could see what I see in my head... they would know I'm about to have a math breakthrough any day now... and people should take this very serious, and if they are not.... yea well.... if they just downplay me like all the smug math and tech bros.. good luck with the crypto apocalypse, because PKI schemes suck and they just assume someone isn't going to waste years trying to break them. But I am going to waste years trying to break them and I am going to succeed, because I can see it in my head and I don't care. Fuck you all. Watch what happens tomorrow.

Pete hegseth is such a fucking loser. Bro should grow some eyes on his back. Cry baby bitch. He's an obviously insecure man, of small stature. Hasn't seen honorable combat in his entire life. Just a fucking bitch loser trying to act though. Fucking despise weaklings like pete hegseth. Come to europe and ill fucking hunt you down you fucking american piece of shit.

Update: Shit mood today. Fucking hate people. Updating my paper, documenting my bridge to number field sieve and what i've found. That should be enough already for others to complete my work while I complete it myself in the coming days.... fuck you assholes.

Update: Updated my paper a little. Now I figure out the very last step (see paper). Should be easy enough. 

Update: Oops, too fast. Re-uploaded and fixed a bunch of types. HAhahaa... almost there now fuckers.
