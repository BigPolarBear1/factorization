Will upload the final version of the PoC soon.
I have finally managed to make the link with number field sieve. 
I'm documenting those findings at chapter 7 in my paper.

This shouldn't take much longer now.

Meanwhile, I got to hear today the belgian police have opened a terrorism case against me. Guess pete hegseth isn't very tough like he pretends.
Finishing this math in the coming days, it will be the final thing I do. 
Fuck this shit world. Thanks to the americans and microsoft I will never see my friends anymore. They have taken everything from me that was once worth living for. 
This last two years have been a nightmare, and have only served to finish this. This will have been my life's work.

Shit day... I will try to finish this this weekend. Having a hard time thinking clearly right now with the police coming here to announce they opened a terrorism case against me.
I will finish this work, and then I'm gone. I'm not going to subject myself to this humiliation and everything else they have been doing these last 2 years. Can't touch me if i'm not here anymore. losers.

I think tomorrow I will make preparations to flee the country. I'll just go on foot. Rather be homeless for a little while then this.

To finish the PoC:

So the paper and PoC both demonstrate clearly, how if we find a multiple of smooth, that is a square multiple,  we can easily modify those coefficients and take the gcd.
you need to use number field sieve's approach, using legendre symbols in a matrix to find that square multiple. 
I'm hoping to show it this weekend... time has ran out. Especially since the US government is pursueing a terrorism case against me. They are really afraid of "dudes in dresses". Fucking provocators.
