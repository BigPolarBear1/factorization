EUREKA!!!

Yesterday I added chapter 7 to the paper. 
This correlates my work to number field sieves approach.
I dug a little deeper today, and I figured out how to construct a vastly superior factorization algorithm. 

If you see the proof of concept that I uploaded some days ago.. the find_similar one... it starts the same, we find a smooth using regular SIQS. But then we only have to enumerate linear coefficients at the same quadratic coefficient, and simply adjust the coefficients. And we achieve factorization immediatly. This second step after finding the initial smooth, shouldn't take much time. So the algorithm will be limited by how quickly we find a single smooth. 

I will update the paper with what I found tomorrow and uploaded a PoC shortly after.

Unless microsoft pays my former manager 100 million (because they waited too long the price has gone up) right now, then I might postpone.

Factorization has fallen. Prepare yourselves. Prepare yourselves for the disaster of your own making.
I wanted to sell my work. You chased away buyers and ruined my life, drive me to the brink of hopelessness and despair. 

You all deserve what is coming. Dies Irae. 

The time of reckoning is now.

I will bring the future into this world. And you are either with me, or against me. 
Playtime is over, now we get serious.

ps: The american cryptologic advantage got fucked by a "dude in a dress". Morrons. Tell pete hegseth, military leadership is about strategy. You win wars with strategy. Not by acting like a shit for brains morron. You got outplayed by a "dude in a dress", fucking losers.
