DISCLAIMER: AT NO POINT IN MY 2.5 YEARS OF RESEARCH DID I USE AI OR HAS AI IN ANY WAY HELPED WITH MY RESEARCH. I'M PUTTING THIS HERE BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE WILL ACCUSE ME OF IT. And honestly, I hate AI. In its current state, it is literally plagiarizing people without giving credits, nothing more. And if I don't finish my work soon, I am sure some morron using AI will claim a breakthrough in factorization because chatgpt or some shit scraped my github repo. I will only change my opinion about AI if AI destroyes microsoft and all those other corporate goons who are way in over their heads, thinking them and their pathetic coke snorting corporate lawyers rule the world. I piss on big tech. Fucking losers. Quit your jobs losers, you all suck. Everyone at microsoft, google, meta, whatever, you all fucking suck.

Note: Remember, as this now comes to completion in the coming days. Both the FBI and Microsoft knew I was working on factorization when I had only been working on it for a few months and nobody else in the entire world knew I was working on it. I tried desperately to avoid the path of public disclosure as I would have much rather sold my work. But at every turn people made it impossible. This would not have happened 10 years ago. An oppurtunity presented itself, it was literally handed to you on a silver platter.. and instead you people all treated me like shit and gambled on me failing with my project. I ask you, where has your common sense gone? I hate what this will do to everyone around me, this is never what I wanted. PS: I know Microsoft's PR teams will say a lot of awful shit about me, completely lacking of context, because that is just the type of people they are. If you want to know who I really am, I suggest you talk to my former teamlead and my former manager who Microsoft retaliated against for defending me. I'm done with this entire shit industry. Everything that happened, you should think whose fault this really is. Maybe instead of morrons sitting on golden thrones build with big tech money, pointing fingers at everyone whose skills and drive hurt their fragile little egoes.. maybe start using your brains, because you people keep losing and keep making things worse.

Note2: I am antifa, leader of the cipherpunk, fuck the FBI department. 

Note3: Once Improved_QS_Variant is finished, I will rewrite most portions of the paper completely from start. I keep finding myself "maturing" out of these papers.. because I keep learning and advancing with my math skills. There's so much stuff in that paper that I just want to completely rewrite because even to me it looks way too amateuristic now.

Note4: I am utterly broke so if anyone wants to make donations to keep this research going a little longer: big_polar_bear1@proton.me email me... thanks.

#### To run from folder "QS_variant" (Standard SIQS with our number theory as backend):</br></br>
To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run: python3 run_qs.py -keysize 220 -base 20_000 -debug 1 -lin_size 10_000_000 -quad_size 1</br></br>

See below for an improved way of performing what this PoC does.. I'll delete this Proof of Concept once the PoC for Improved_QS_Variant matures a little more<br><br>

Note: With a large enough -base and lin_size this PoC will find smooths for 110 digits. Albeit very slowly, but this is a highly unoptimized cython PoC. However, to push beyond that into novel terroritory for Quadratic Sieve-based algorithms we need to use quadratic coefficients and p-adic lifting, and that is what the PoC below (Improved_QS_Variant) will be for.

Update: Modified some things in generate_modulus. So right now it's just generating a modulus within a certain size range... and then tries to find one last square to multiply it that gets both root and modulus within a certain range... very bruteforce.. but this is the right approach. Next I need to figure out how to make this better and less bruteforce. For that I need to actually do pen and paper and dive into the math. There's also stuff I can always do with the quadratic coefficient to resize roots. Or hashmaps to lookup similar roots... just stuff like that.. but yea.. I need to work out the details... let me get focused for a few days... this is the final missing piece of the algorithm. I have already deduced that this is the only way to punch past 110 digits. There just isn't any other way that this can be done.  

Update: I will take a break for today. This weekend I will begin working on this final part of the algorithm. The next time I upload code.. it will mean I have figured it out. This is the last thing that stands between me and finishing my project. I know it will be slower for small numbers then SIQS.. but this gives us a fighting chance against very large numbers. An algorithm to find small-ish roots and large moduli that's what I need to figure out now. I can resize roots with quadratic coefficients. I can precalculate stuff like residues to look up in a hashmap. I can perform p-adic lifting quickly. The board is set. Now it's time for me to make my final move. This will be over soon. And the future will be gay. HAHAHAHAHA.

Update: Ended up doing some more thinking. So getting a modulus of the bitlength we want is straight forward... however getting a root and modulus that are both the size we want is when things get complicated. But using the quadratic coefficient I can resize the root while keeping the size of the modulus. I believe hence that this is my most promising angle of attack. Let me spent an entire weekend on this. And ofcourse, if we just multiply the quadratic coefficient with a factor from the "quadratic factor base" (see qbase in PoC)... we can repeat these multiplications indefintetly until we get that root size we want. I see my path forward. I am utterly convinced of the novelty of my work. Everyone be damned to hell. I know there is deception going on. If you treat me like the enemy, I will become the enemy. Fuck you fucking losers. I'm a polar bear. I am stronger then any man or woman alive. I'll destroy you all.
