DISCLAIMER: AT NO POINT IN MY 2.5 YEARS OF RESEARCH DID I USE AI OR HAS AI IN ANY WAY HELPED WITH MY RESEARCH. I'M PUTTING THIS HERE BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE WILL ACCUSE ME OF IT. 

Note: Remember, as this now comes to completion in the coming days. Both the FBI and Microsoft knew I was working on factorization when I had only been working on it for a few months and nobody else in the entire world knew I was working on it. I tried desperately to avoid the path of public disclosure as I would have much rather sold my work. But at every turn people made it impossible. This would not have happened 10 years ago. An oppurtunity presented itself, it was literally handed to you on a silver platter.. and instead you people all treated me like shit and gambled on me failing with my project. I ask you, where has your common sense gone? I hate what this will do to everyone around me, this is never what I wanted.

Note: I am antifa, leader of the cipherpunk, fuck the FBI department. 

#### To run from folder "QS_variant" (Standard SIQS with our number theory as backend):</br></br>
To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run: python3 run_qs.py -keysize 200 -base 2000 -debug 1 -lin_size 100_000 -quad_size 1</br></br>

See below for an improved way of performing what this PoC does.. I'll delete this Proof of Concept once the PoC for Improved_QS_Variant matures a little more<br><br>
#### To run from folder "Improved_QS_Variant" (Implements more of my number theory to also take advantage of quadratic coefficients):</br></br>

To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run: python3 run_qs.py -keysize 120  -base 2000 -debug 1 -lin_size 100_000 -quad_size 1</br></br>

Big speed gains. We can now do 120 bit in a few seconds AAAAAAAAAAAND potentially finish earlier before reaching the amount of smooths normal SIQS would require.
Just run with the above command. I will keep tinkering an upload improvements as I go.
