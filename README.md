DISCLAIMER: AT NO POINT IN MY 2.5 YEARS OF RESEARCH DID I USE AI OR HAS AI IN ANY WAY HELPED WITH MY RESEARCH. I'M PUTTING THIS HERE BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE WILL ACCUSE ME OF IT. 

Note: I am antifa, leader of the cipherpunk, fuck the FBI department. 

Note2: It's basically done now, the NFS variant is nearing completion soon, nothing novel research wise has to be figured out now. I just need to refactor a few things and I'm done.
I have been unemployed for 2 years. I am looking for work. I would like some way where I can have enough time to attack ECC and DLP next. In addition, for a payment, I can also show people how I appraoched factorization from start to finish. Because the method of how I conduct my research and consistently have success is just as valueable as the research itself. And I follow the same patterns over and over again, no matter what subject matter I attack. I don't have a very high IQ and I'm not especially bright or good at doing numbers in my head. But I have insights into research that help me succeed over and over again. I'm willing to teach people how to do it, as long as it enables me to have the finances to continue doing my research aside from that. Contact: big_polar_bear1@proton.me.

#### To run from folder "QS_variant" (Standard SIQS with our number theory as backend):</br></br>
To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run: python3 run_qs.py -keysize 200 -base 6000 -debug 1 -lin_size 100_000 -quad_size 1</br></br>
This version is somewhat done, but it doesn't achieve much of an advantage, as the main strength of my work will be the NFS_Variant, which performs NFS with reducible quadratic polynomials<br><br>
#### To run from folder "NFS_variant" (Number Field Sieve with our number theory as backend using reducible quadratic polynomials mod m):</br></br>

I just uploaded polarbearalg_v32.py</br>
To run: python3 polarbearalg_v32.py -keysize 20</br>

Coming soon

Update: Ok 3 am. I'm going to sleep now. Got a bit chaotic in my head. It is legendre symbols, not p-adic lifting that must be employed now. I need to use the output generated by the polynomials of the other side of the congruence I believe to grab the correct legendre symbols. That logically makes the most sense by far. Let me verify tomorrow.

The gay future better be the best shit ever. Otherwise I have sacrificed my life for nothing. Maybe I dont have many friends in this world, but I have many friends in the gay future hahahahahahaha.

Update: Alright, I am awoken again. Some days I really hate being unemployed and broke. Just suffocating being stuck in this small room. Not able to see any of the friends I used to have anymore. I don't even hear from them anymore. Which is probably for the best, because being associated with me might get then into trouble in the US. Even if I don't finish my work today or tomorrow .... people would see that I'm doing everything right, that I am making progress as time passes... that I keep digging deeper and deeper into this. They would see that I am doing math research the right way, even if my writings are not algebraic letter soup. The only way I can explain this is that they must be violently downplaying everything I do. Which makes sense because it was the same when I did bug hunting. I mean... look at all that shit people do with windows installer... nobody even remembers who first came up with that stuff (me). And even microsoft has retroactively downplayed my work, literally rewriting history. Even though I had the proof of concepts to proof beyond a doubt that I was right. I should have never worked for that company. Hell, I should have never became a bug hunter. The worst industry with the worst people. It has a lot of people who think they are smart because they hold a fancy degree... but most of these people are just good at juggling fancy words.. they don't posses true intelligence... they posses pseudo intelligence, the most dangerous kind... the kind that led to the sorry state of the world we are currently living in.

You know, I really wished I hadn't found out that microsoft had gone in and retroactively downgraded one of my remote RCE bugs. Which should have been a critical bug. But they argued that since it was a stack buffer overrun it would need to be combined with an info leak, so they released it as important initially. (which didn't make sense, because they rate remote stack buffer overruns as critical all the time). Then after they fired me, they somehow downgraded it to info disclosure. Which makes even less sense since I literally had a POC proving full control over the size and contents of the stack overflow. That CVE was bundled with some OOB reads as well.... but that still doesn't make sense. Someone would have gone back after they fired me, and literally took the time to downgrade my work. Which makes me feel even more angry. These people NEVER valued my work. They were jealous of everything I did from the start. If I ever see anyone from MSRC, they better start running for their life. Im not kidding. I will go to jail if I ever see anyone from MSRC.
