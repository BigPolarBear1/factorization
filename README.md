Disclaimer: At no point did AI contribute anything to this research project. Copilot can't even calculate basic congruences without making mistakes. People who think AI can do novel math research are delusional. I did not use AI for the paper, and I did not use AI for any of the code. I attacked this problem, from the very basics 3 years ago, slowly burrowing deeper and deeper. </br>
Disclaimer2: I never finished highschool. I started working on this 3 years ago, not even knowing basic algebra (I can explain exactly how I can to all the conclusions I came to if someone ever cares to hear about it). This is 3 years. I'm only going to get better. I'm still far away from plateauing skill wise.

The day I break factorization will be day 0 of the gay future. A better world will be born. A world of human creativity. A world of art, science and spirituality. A world without suffering. I will see that world become reality, no matter the cost.

#### About the paper
Math paper is a work in progress. The final chapters are a bit rushed and building an algorithm around p-adic lifting isnt as straight forward as I had assumed. I do think there is an angle there I can exploit, but I'll do some further experimentation first and get a working PoC before I make edits to the paper again.

P-adic Sieve to do:

Next we need to calculate residues for 4th degree polynomials. My hope is that we can correlate the results from 2nd degree polynomials with these to generate square solutions from nearly-square solutions. Since the paper shows how solutions in Z correlate with these binomial expansions. And this is also demonstrated in binomial_sieve. Thinking laterally, trying to correlate residue results from different degrees, might actually allow me to crack this wide open. We'll see. Furthermore, it is also p-adicly lifting singular roots (meaning the derivative is zero mod p^e) and when we cant lift further we then check if the resulting discriminant yields a quadratic residue in mod p^(e+1). This allows us to eliminate coefficients whose discriminant most definitely are not going to yield a square in Z. 

In theory this setup should absolutely work.. and we can even go up and calculate 6th degree.. and so on. And then if they have the same root residues and discriminant mod p^e just chinese remainder it all together to generate the solution in Z. Bc they will all be distinct modular reductions of the solution in Z... due to how these coefficients change as we perform binomial expanions. Its the best bet I have to break this problem wide open.

Just sieves with binomial expansions... for use with the paper. I hope to combine everything learned in the last 3 years in psieve.

Additionally cuda support must be enabled. I did this on wsl2 (easy to setup), since it gets a lot harder to access the GPU on a virtual machine.

This was an attempt at finding smooths with similar factorization using an SIQS variant. By using quadratic coefficients. But it didnt end up working as I had hoped so I abondoned this approach, but perhaps someone will get some use out of it.

This basically creates a system of quadratics. Solving them mod p is easy. But there is only one root solution (the factor of N) which solves the system for 0 for any mod p (aka solves it in the integers). Figuring out how to exactly do this quickly is still an ongoing area of research for me. And if a polynomial time algorithm for factorization exists, it is likely done by solving this system of quadratics. Finding a polyomial time algorithm is my ultimate goal, as this would make progress toward solving p = np as well.
