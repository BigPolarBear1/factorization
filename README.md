The purpose of this research is to destroy spewers of anti-lgbtq hate (Russia, MAGA) and bring forth the gay future. Also, pete hegseth is a little man and a coward. And so is that pig erdogan and all those other "traditional family values right wing nut jobs" rounding up LGBTQ people simply for existing. Don't travel to Europe. In Europe, nobody gets persecuted for who they are, and people who do shouldn't come here. And maybe people in European politics have forgotten what Europe stands for, but fck them, grow a spine already, because Europe is all that is left of the free world now. People used to take pride in defending freedom and protecting the innocent. What has this world become? Where did courage go? Sick and tired of spineless cowards.

Disclaimer: No AI was used for any of this except for generating some of the code for well-known mathematical functions (it is indicated in my code when it's AI generated), and others are copy pasted from the references listed below, but all the novel logic is written by me by hand. I've also not used it for any of the research itself. Most of the foundation I already came up with 3 years ago (if people still remember that bad LLL implementation I wrote way back.. that one abused exactly the same principles I'm still exploiting here.. it just took time for me to mature mathematically and make the correct connections with the framework I had come up with).

#### About the paper
Math paper is a work in progress. Ignore the final chapter for now.. that one I'll rewrite if and when I can get "psieve" below working correctly.

#### To run from folder "psieve" WORK IN PROGRES...extremely early version:</br>
To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run:  python3 run_qs.py -keysize 100 -base 10_000 -debug 0 -lin_size 100 -quad_size 1</br></br>

This starts with an SIQS variant where the stripped away factors are square to minimize the odd exponent factors in the bsmooth and after that we use the research from the paper in psieve(). This then utilizes a two sided approach and looks for similar b-smooths by calculating quadratic residues.

Update: Getting very close now. There's some additional research to be done still... its almost finished though. One thing I want to research is the commented out code at the bottom of psieve() where it checks roots by CRT. I need to rewrite that into a smart hensel implementation and see if it can find valid solutions that lie outside the bounds of the interval easily somehow. There is also a very deep pattern based on quadratic reciprocity here that dictates when psieve succeeds that needs further exploration. This is why you cannot set "a" as an aribtrary small prime in psieve.. it has to come from existing b-smooths.. I know some of the conditions that must be met but others are still hidden and unless I find them using existing b-smooths is the only way. But very happy were its at now.

Note: Aaaalot of dead code that needs to be pruned. Will do it tomorrow.

#### To run from folder "Coefficient_Sieve" (For use with the paper):</br></br>
To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run:  python3 run_qs.py -keysize 40 -base 50 -debug 1 -lin_size 10_000 -quad_size 100</br>

Just demonstrates the math from the paper using quadratics. For educational purposes. And rather then taking a square root over a large prime we can also just calculate the discriminant. But this demonstrates the interesting relation between these quadratics and the factors of N.

#### To run debug.py" (Prints the linear and quadratic coefficients to solve for 0 in the integers, for use with my paper):</br></br>

To run: python3 debug.py -keysize 12

This basically creates a system of quadratics. Solving them mod p is easy. But there is only one root solution (the factor of N) which solves the system for 0 for any mod p (aka solves it in the integers). Figuring out how to exactly do this quickly is still an ongoing area of research for me. And if a polynomial time algorithm for factorization exists, it is likely done by solving this system of quadratics.
