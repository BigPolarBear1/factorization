This version is somewhat done, but it doesn't achieve much of an advantage, as the main strength of my work will be the NFS_Variant, which performs NFS with reducible quadratic polynomials<br><br>

Ignore the other PoCs in that folder. 
I learned some things over the weekend. 
What I was doing last month with square multiple of a smooth. 
I managed to finally understand that much deeper and generalizing it to just having to find a square mod m. 
so if we have y0^2-N\*4\*z instead of finding a square in the integers, we find one mod m. 
I'll try to upload a PoC tomorrow.

Update: 1am, I should stop staring at math now. I'll fix everything tomorrow. DAMNIT. I see how it works now. I really finally see how it works now. I see how you can find squares mod m and achieve factorization. Without having to do smooth finding in the integers. I sure hope my research is flying under the radar. Imagine if someone raised the alarms like half a year ago, and half the world is looking at me taking fucking months to piece together all these simple math things. I would sure look like a proper clown. I'm going to quit math. Galois, Fermat, Legendre nor Euler would have taken this long. Sure, I started from 0 math skills 2.5 years ago. But after 2.5 years... I shouldn't still be struggling with fucking quadratics man. It's fucking quadratics. How the fuck am I going to do Diophantine equations and stuff like that if I can't even do this. The only thing easier then quadratics is literally 1 + 1 = 2 type of shit. I'm literally struggling with the basics of math. Fuck. Should have stuck with 0days. 

I think a lot about live lately. What happened in the US and what msft did, it permanently changed. Ever since, I only feel rage and sadness. Everyone I know, is building families, buying homes, living life. I've just been grinding factorization. And beyond that, I want nothing. I will go into the arctic and die alone during a winter storm one day. Far away from humans. I'm not going to grow old in this shit world.
