#### To run debug.py" (Prints the linear and quadratic coefficients to solve for 0 in the integers, for use with my paper):</br></br>

To run: python3 debug.py -keysize 12

This basically creates a system of quadratics. Solving them mod p is easy. But there is only one root solution (the factor of N) which solves the system for 0 for any mod p (aka solves it in the integers). Figuring out how to exactly do this quickly is still an ongoing area of research for me. And if a polynomial time algorithm for factorization exists, it is likely done by solving this system of quadratics. Finding a polyomial time algorithm is my ultimate goal, as this would make progress toward solving p = np as well.

Additionally cuda support must be enabled. I did this on wsl2 (easy to setup), since it gets a lot harder to access the GPU on a virtual machine.

Update: While making this PoC, I suddenly had an idea, linking back to some things I tried earlier last spring. See below (I think this approach is interesting, but its hard to get an advantage.. however using these different multiples of N.. there is a much easier way to exploit this, hence see NFS_variant):

#### To run from folder "nfs_variant" (WIP):</br></br>

Note: Experimental WORK IN PROGRESS.</br>
To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>

UPDATE: Going to take a break for today. The idea I'm playing with is promising. I just need to approach it the correct way. So as I am doing it now.. the discriminant will be divisible by the modulus.. in theory this means that if I can grow that modulus then eventually that discriminant will factor over the factor base entirely... and then I have a way to attack factorization with this setup. It is also trivial to combine quadratics with the same coefficients.. which is totally something you can do... so let me explore that idea further starting next week. Sometimes I make wrong assumptions, or I'm too quick asuming something works a certain way.. but its part of the research process. But most people dont understand what research actually is. Research is years of trial and error and slowly chipping away at complexity. Its not a clean process. Its very messy and thats just the way it is.
