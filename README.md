Update: It would appear the americans are continueing to legally harass me because pete hegseth is a fucking loser and coward who has to hide behind the law. So much for all his pathetic bravado. Fucking pussy. If anyone wants to help cover legal costs email: big_polar_bear1@proton.me ... I am also considering fleeing europe, if anyone can grant me asylum also reach out, thanks.

DISCLAIMER: AT NO POINT IN MY 2.5 YEARS OF RESEARCH DID I USE AI OR HAS AI IN ANY WAY HELPED WITH MY RESEARCH. I'M PUTTING THIS HERE BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE WILL ACCUSE ME OF IT. 

Note: I am antifa, leader of the cipherpunk, fuck the FBI department. 

Note2: Once Improved_QS_Variant is finished, I will rewrite most portions of the paper completely from start. I keep finding myself "maturing" out of these papers.. because I keep learning and advancing with my math skills. There's so much stuff in that paper that I just want to completely rewrite because even to me it looks way too amateuristic now.

Note3: I am utterly broke so if anyone wants to make donations to keep this research going a little longer: big_polar_bear1@proton.me email me... thanks.

Note4: If what I'm trying to do currently doesn't work, I will completely abandon the quadratic sieve type of approach. Because using the number theory I worked out, another approach would be is to directly find a factor of N. Since using the factors of N solves the quadratic for 0 for any mod m when the correct linear and quadratic coefficients are used. So this will be the next avenue I will explore. 

#### To run debug.py" (Prints the linear and quadratic coefficients to solve for 0 in the integers, for use with my paper):</br></br>

To run: python3 debug.py -keysize 12

This basically creates a system of quadratics. Solving them mod p is easy. But there is only one root solution (the factor of N) which solves the system for 0 for any mod p (aka solves it in the integers). Figuring out how to exactly do this quickly is still an ongoing area of research for me. And if a polynomial time algorithm for factorization exists, it is likely done by solving this system of quadratics. Finding a polyomial time algorithm is my ultimate goal, as this would make progress toward solving p = np as well. 

#### To run from folder "QS_variant" (Standard SIQS with our number theory as backend):</br></br>
To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run: python3 run_qs.py -keysize 220 -base 20_000 -debug 1 -lin_size 10_000_000 -quad_size 1</br></br>

See below for an improved way of performing what this PoC does.. I'll delete this Proof of Concept once the PoC for Improved_QS_Variant matures a little more<br><br>

Note: With a large enough -base and lin_size this PoC will find smooths for 110 digits. Albeit very slowly, but this is a highly unoptimized cython PoC. However, to push beyond that into novel terroritory for Quadratic Sieve-based algorithms we need to use quadratic coefficients and p-adic lifting, and that is what the PoC below (Improved_QS_Variant) will be for. 

#### To run from folder "Improved_QS_Variant" (Implements more of my number theory and attempts to succeed with fewer smooths by using p-adic lifting):</br></br>

To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run:python3 run_qs.py -keysize 80 -base 10_000 -sbase 500 -debug 1 -quad_size 100_000</br></br>

Update: Fixed the PoC so it can factor again. All the logic is in generate_large_square(). Its going to generate smooths that are roughly the size of keysize/2. I think this setup is the best I can do. Next I need to further reduce that bitlength with known factors... for that I will need to implement sieving. However.. I need to sieve over the length of all quadratic coefficient. Not just for one quadratic coefficient like default SIQS does. I'll do some brain storming how this is best approached. So the current setup if we take 400 bits.. it will generate roughly smooth candidates of 200 bits.. the size of the quadratic coefficient doesn't really matter... because we filter those in advance so they factor over the factor base. We could in theory use much larger values there. I could for each valid quadratic coefficient add a small sieve interval.. and then just fill them out before generate_large_square. Plus I can also use that larger sieve interval for marking larger squares using lifting. I think it may just be a matter of making sure all those calculations are done fast enough. Let me construct some sieving tomorrow.
