Disclaimer: At no point did AI contribute anything to this research project. Copilot can't even calculate basic congruences without making mistakes. People who think AI can do novel math research are delusional.

NOTE: Starting 2026, none of my research will be published. Only people who treat me with respect will be allowed access to my work. And NATO countries/big tech are very low on that list after harassing me for years and treating me like shit. And I garantuee you, I will succeed at finding a polynomial time algorithm. There is no one else alive in this fucking world more determined then me to succeed at this. Fucking losers.


#### To run debug.py" (Prints the linear and quadratic coefficients to solve for 0 in the integers, for use with my paper):</br></br>

To run: python3 debug.py -keysize 12

This basically creates a system of quadratics. Solving them mod p is easy. But there is only one root solution (the factor of N) which solves the system for 0 for any mod p (aka solves it in the integers). Figuring out how to exactly do this quickly is still an ongoing area of research for me. And if a polynomial time algorithm for factorization exists, it is likely done by solving this system of quadratics. Finding a polyomial time algorithm is my ultimate goal, as this would make progress toward solving p = np as well. 

#### To run from folder "CUDA_QS_variant" (WIP):</br></br>
To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run: python3 run_qs.py -keysize 120 -base 500 -debug 1 -lin_size 100_000 -quad_size 100</br></br>

Prerequisites: </br>
-Python (tested on 3.13)</br>
-Numpy (tested on 1.26.2)</br>
-Sympy</br>
-cupy-cuda13x</br>
-cython</br>
-setuptools</br>
(please open an issues here if something doesn't work)</br></br>

Additionally cuda support must be enabled. I did this on wsl2 (easy to setup), since it gets a lot harder to access the GPU on a virtual machine.

Update: Let me do some pen and paper for a second. There is this thing with composite moduli in theory which could be used to speed all of this up by a huge factor. 
Because zx^2 mod m, is always going to produce the same values on our interval for some certain zx^2 value mod m. I've worked out all that math and I understand it. So how can I use multiple smaller composite moduli to quickly construct larger intervals? 

That is the key to a fast algorithm.. I got to think out of the box here. So let me stop right here, stop tinkering with that PoC. And work out the math on how we can construct large intervals using small intervals mod m. Its all just repeating patterns mod m anyway.. it should't be too difficult.
