DISCLAIMER: AT NO POINT IN MY 2.5 YEARS OF RESEARCH DID I USE AI OR HAS AI IN ANY WAY HELPED WITH MY RESEARCH. I'M PUTTING THIS HERE BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE WILL ACCUSE ME OF IT. 

Note: Remember, as this now comes to completion in the coming days. Both the FBI and Microsoft knew I was working on factorization when I had only been working on it for a few months and nobody else in the entire world knew I was working on it. I tried desperately to avoid the path of public disclosure as I would have much rather sold my work. But at every turn people made it impossible. This would not have happened 10 years ago. An oppurtunity presented itself, it was literally handed to you on a silver platter.. and instead you people all treated me like shit and gambled on me failing with my project. I ask you, where has your common sense gone? I hate what this will do to everyone around me, this is never what I wanted. PS: I know Microsoft's PR teams will say a lot of awful shit about me, completely lacking of context, because that is just the type of people they are. If you want to know who I really am, I suggest you talk to my former teamlead and my former manager who Microsoft retaliated against for defending me. I'm done with this entire shit industry. Everything that happened, you should think whose fault this really is. Maybe instead of morrons sitting on golden thrones build with big tech money, pointing fingers at everyone whose skills and drive hurt their fragile little egoes.. maybe start using your brains, because you people keep losing and keep making things worse.

Note2: I am antifa, leader of the cipherpunk, fuck the FBI department. 

Note3: Once Improved_QS_Variant is finished, I will rewrite most portions of the paper completely from start. I keep finding myself "maturing" out of these papers.. because I keep learning and advancing with my math skills. There's so much stuff in that paper that I just want to completely rewrite because even to me it looks way too amateuristic now.

Note4: I am utterly broke so if anyone wants to make donations to keep this research going a little longer: big_polar_bear1@proton.me email me... thanks.

#### To run from folder "QS_variant" (Standard SIQS with our number theory as backend):</br></br>
To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run: python3 run_qs.py -keysize 220 -base 20_000 -debug 1 -lin_size 10_000_000 -quad_size 1</br></br>

See below for an improved way of performing what this PoC does.. I'll delete this Proof of Concept once the PoC for Improved_QS_Variant matures a little more<br><br>

Note: With a large enough -base and lin_size this PoC will find smooths for 110 digits. Albeit very slowly, but this is a highly unoptimized cython PoC. However, to push beyond that into novel terroritory for Quadratic Sieve-based algorithms we need to use quadratic coefficients and p-adic lifting, and that is what the PoC below (Improved_QS_Variant) will be for. 

#### To run from folder "Improved_QS_Variant" (Implements more of my number theory and attempts to succeed with fewer smooths by using p-adic lifting):</br></br>

To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run: python3 run_qs.py -keysize 60 -base 5_000 -sbase 1_000 -debug 1 -quad_size 100_000</br></br>

UPDATE: Just uploaded a new PoC. It completely tanked the performance for now... but it is all as expected. I just removed the sieve interval completely, since we cant use it with the appraoch we will be implementing.

To do: Generate modulus should be moved inside the loop that iterate quadratic coefficients. We should just recalculate all the roots if we increase the quadratic coefficient. Then in generate modulus, we need to implement a heuristic, so in addition of getting a modulus of a certain size, we must also get a root of certain size. I know this is feasible. Because based on which primes we multiply the modulus with, we do have control over how much bigger the root grows. This will make generate_modulus become the most intensive loop in the algorithm... so that really needs to become well optimized. Additionally, yes, this will be slower then SIQS up to a certain bit size.. but for really large numbers, this appraoch does have a chance of finding smooths.
