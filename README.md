DISCLAIMER: AT NO POINT IN MY 2.5 YEARS OF RESEARCH DID I USE AI OR HAS AI IN ANY WAY HELPED WITH MY RESEARCH. I'M PUTTING THIS HERE BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE WILL ACCUSE ME OF IT. 

Note: Remember, as this now comes to completion in the coming days. Both the FBI and Microsoft knew I was working on factorization when I had only been working on it for a few months and nobody else in the entire world knew I was working on it. I tried desperately to avoid the path of public disclosure as I would have much rather sold my work. But at every turn people made it impossible. This would not have happened 10 years ago. An oppurtunity presented itself, it was literally handed to you on a silver platter.. and instead you people all treated me like shit and gambled on me failing with my project. I ask you, where has your common sense gone? I hate what this will do to everyone around me, this is never what I wanted.

Note: I am antifa, leader of the cipherpunk, fuck the FBI department. 

#### To run from folder "QS_variant" (Standard SIQS with our number theory as backend):</br></br>
To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run: python3 run_qs.py -keysize 200 -base 2000 -debug 1 -lin_size 100_000 -quad_size 1</br></br>

See below for an improved way of performing what this PoC does.. I'll delete this Proof of Concept once the PoC for Improved_QS_Variant matures a little more<br><br>

Just run it on 100 bit using the command above for now. I fixed some very ugly bugs that I missed in the version that I uploaded yesterday. I'll upload further improvements soon.
Also moody because I bought new running shoes through amazon, like Hoka trail running shoes.. but when they arrived they were 2.5 sizes larger then what I had ordered.. so I had to send it back, which cost me 40 eur in return costs to send it all the way back to eastern europe... in addition to what I paid (which I may or may not see paid back, bc this entire shit seems shady).. just losing so much money ordering shit from amazon that either gets lost or ends up being wrong. And I'm nearly broke.. it's like someone is trying to drain my money on purpose. This shit never happened when I ordered from amazon in Canada or in the US. I dont know. Just hard to focus being so close to running out of my savings now... cant even find a job and after how this industry treated me, no way im doing bug bounties again.
