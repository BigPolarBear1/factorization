URGENT NOTE: I am urgently looking for any country to grant me a visa and employment. A country that doesn't extradite to the US.
I am running out of time. The US has initiated a terrorism case against me, and the police here in Belgium said they would have me declared as a terrorist internationally, so I would get arrested when I travel.
I need to get out of Belgium to a safe country ASAP.
I can do 0day research and I can do math. I know many people don't believe in my math, but I know what I've found and I'm piecing together the final pieces now.
Furthermore, I have found bugs in hard targets like OpenSsl and I can easily repeat those feats again. I havn't been able to do 0day research at all because of being in a place that has been actively hostile towards me, chasing away 0day buyers.
I cannot research in a hostile place when that research's value depends entirely on secrecy. 
Please contact me: big_polar_bear1@proton.me 
They might arrest me at the airport when I try to leave, but I'm willing to give it a shot as I have nothing left to lose. And my family would support me in my choice.
I do get contact by internet trolls all the time, so please contact me from an official email or invite me to an embassy... just so I know it is legit and I don't end up trying to fly somewhere without a visa and potentially wasting the very last of my savings.


Will upload the final version of the PoC soon.
I have finally managed to make the link with number field sieve. 
I'm documenting those findings at chapter 7 in my paper.

This shouldn't take much longer now.

Meanwhile, I got to hear today the belgian police have opened a terrorism case against me. Guess pete hegseth isn't very tough like he pretends.
Finishing this math in the coming days, it will be the final thing I do. 
Fuck this shit world. Thanks to the americans and microsoft I will never see my friends anymore. They have taken everything from me that was once worth living for. 
This last two years have been a nightmare, and have only served to finish this. This will have been my life's work.

Shit day... I will try to finish this this weekend. Having a hard time thinking clearly right now with the police coming here to announce they opened a terrorism case against me.
I will finish this work, and then I'm gone. I'm not going to subject myself to this humiliation and everything else they have been doing these last 2 years. Can't touch me if i'm not here anymore. losers.

I think tomorrow I will make preparations to flee the country. I'll just go on foot. Rather be homeless for a little while then this.
