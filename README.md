DISCLAIMER: AT NO POINT IN MY 2.5 YEARS OF RESEARCH DID I USE AI OR HAS AI IN ANY WAY HELPED WITH MY RESEARCH. I'M PUTTING THIS HERE BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE WILL ACCUSE ME OF IT. 

Note: I am antifa, leader of the cipherpunk, fuck the FBI department. 

Note2: It's basically done now, the NFS variant is nearing completion soon, nothing novel research wise has to be figured out now. I just need to refactor a few things and I'm done.
I have been unemployed for 2 years. I am looking for work. I would like some way where I can have enough time to attack ECC and DLP next. In addition, for a payment, I can also show people how I appraoched factorization from start to finish. Because the method of how I conduct my research and consistently have success is just as valueable as the research itself. And I follow the same patterns over and over again, no matter what subject matter I attack. I don't have a very high IQ and I'm not especially bright or good at doing numbers in my head. But I have insights into research that help me succeed over and over again. I'm willing to teach people how to do it, as long as it enables me to have the finances to continue doing my research aside from that. Contact: big_polar_bear1@proton.me.

This version is somewhat done, but it doesn't achieve much of an advantage, as the main strength of my work will be the NFS_Variant, which performs NFS with reducible quadratic polynomials<br><br>

I've added some legendre symbols to that loop that tries to find the correct multiplier for the quadratic coefficient. 
And actually thinking about this, I need to get these legendre symbols working in my linear algebra step, similar to what NFS does with the quadratic character base.
I was thinking before that I should do p-adic lifting here to find that multiplier... but since the correct solution can be represented by legendre symbols, I should probably just implement that in my linear algebra step... then we don't really need p-adic lifting to find that correct multiplier. So I guess the next step now is to calculate some examples by hand to figure out the exact implementation details of the linear algebra step and how that would work. I think v31 is good now, it shows all the math, and also how legendre symbols come into play. Now it's time to get serious and start building a proper algorithm.

Update: Thinking about deeper about this, if we set the legendre symbols on the results of y1^2+n*y1 ... that might actually work. Where y1 is the smooth candidate we found with zx^2-n ... Its quite fortunate how this comes together actually. Ok ok. Let me work out some examples by hand and begin implementing the code... once that is done, I will upload it, and that will be that.... the end of facctorization. Defeated by a single polar bear. I guess the whole "we don't negotiate with terrorists" doesn't really work if you can't kill said terrorist and prevent the coming disaster. Ofcourse I'm not a terrorist, but I was left with no other choices... I was treated like a terrorist right from the start.... this shit is causing me serious depression. What do I do? Everything is too late already... I cross the threshold now... there is no other choices left. My only other course of action would be to drop everything I'm doing and just accept my fate as an unemployable loser, with really nothing to look forward to... but finishing this, it will likely mean the end of me... and it won't be great for everyone around me.... but maybe I can find a way to earn a little bit of money again and just dissappear into the arctic for a couple of years... I would much prefer that to my current life.... anyway.... expect the linear algebra version to drop soon... once that happens, it's over. It's already over, since all the math is here already... people can figure it out... but once that final PoC drops... everyone and their dog will be able to factor large numbers.

Update: Ok. I'm going for a run now. I'll do some more math when I get back or tomorrow. So I started taking it apart how to get the linear algebra to work... if you multiple smooth candidates together generated with zx^2-n.. then what that polynomial becomes for that multiplied result is quite important.. because we know if that new z value ends up being square, then we have succesful factorization with y1^2+N*y1 = y0^2. It doesn't seem to be too complicated, For example, if we multiply two results together mod 121.. then I know that the new quadratic coefficient will stay the same mod 11. So what I need to do is correctly calculate legendre symbols for other primes I guess. 
Actually... if thats the last thing I need to do... I could be finished as early as tomorrow... one day in the future.. people are going to study the chain of events that led to this failure. Because this is not the outcome I wanted. This is the entire western intelligence apparatus failing because of fucking politics. Should have kept politics out of the equation. This is why China is ahead of the west, everything they do is strategic and calculated. Everything the west does on the other hand is politics.

Update: I am stressed... I see how it works now... pretty sure I have everything to implement the linear algebra tomorrow...and once I upload that... I know what that means, and I know what the consequences will be... and it's so insane everyone just pretends like nothing is happening. I know plenty of people would be checking on my work from time to time.. somebody must have known where this was headed... I guess people where warned not to interact with me... because you know, "I'm an antifa terrorist"... people would have known.. and for that reason alone... should it work tomorrow... I should not feel bad about it... they could have just contacted me and asked me to wait with disclosure. Nothing happened. And if truely, people downplayed me, up until this very moment... then we're about to have a future-shock moment very soon. It says a lot about this world, that they would rather endure a catastrophic disaster then to show someone like me any respect at all. It's hilarious. It's like the world has become a sick parody. But then again, the world has never been a great place to be different. Humans are in essence herd animals.. and so much of their psychology is dictated by that. It's funny how in essence so much of our misery is due to genetic programming. We think we have free will, while we collectively pile onto the newest target of social media drama... like god damn herd animals. I curse you all, you ape brained humans.
