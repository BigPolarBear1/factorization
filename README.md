#### To run debug.py" (Prints the linear and quadratic coefficients to solve for 0 in the integers, for use with my paper):</br></br>

To run: python3 debug.py -keysize 12

This basically creates a system of quadratics. Solving them mod p is easy. But there is only one root solution (the factor of N) which solves the system for 0 for any mod p (aka solves it in the integers). Figuring out how to exactly do this quickly is still an ongoing area of research for me. And if a polynomial time algorithm for factorization exists, it is likely done by solving this system of quadratics. Finding a polyomial time algorithm is my ultimate goal, as this would make progress toward solving p = np as well. 

#### To run from folder "QS_variant" (Standard SIQS with our number theory as backend):</br></br>
To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run: python3 run_qs.py -keysize 220 -base 20_000 -debug 1 -lin_size 10_000_000 -quad_size 1</br></br>

See below for an improved way of performing what this PoC does.. I'll delete this Proof of Concept once the PoC for Improved_QS_Variant matures a little more<br><br>

Note: With a large enough -base and lin_size this PoC will find smooths for 110 digits. Albeit very slowly, but this is a highly unoptimized cython PoC. However, to push beyond that into novel terroritory for Quadratic Sieve-based algorithms we need to use quadratic coefficients and p-adic lifting, and that is what the PoC below (Improved_QS_Variant) will be for. 

#### To run from folder "Improved_QS_Variant" (Building smooths from the ground up... see paper on clues to finish the code):</br></br>

To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run: python3 run_qs.py -key 4387 -base 6 -debug 1 -lin_size 100_000 -quad_size 1</br></br>


Update: I'm missing something still. I shouldn't just use zx^2-n .. I need to use that linear coefficient as well. There's these conditions with regards to the size of the modulus when both the quadratic and discriminant generate the same smooth candidate. Let me hit the reset button one last time. I actually see now how it is possible to sieve with the linear coefficient. It just took me a while to understand all these moving parts.

Update: Ofcourse.. thats actually quite simple... let me upload a PoC that does sieving with the linear coefficient this evening. Its not terribly difficult. 

Update: Actually.. sieving with the linear coefficient is exactly like number field sieve... let me make some speed now that it finally clicked... get atleast a barebones PoC released today and fix chapter 8 in the paper.
