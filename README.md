EUREKA!!!

Yesterday I added chapter 7 to the paper. 
This correlates my work to number field sieves approach.
I dug a little deeper today, and I figured out how to construct a vastly superior factorization algorithm. 

If you see the proof of concept that I uploaded some days ago.. the find_similar one... it starts the same, we find a smooth using regular SIQS. But then we only have to enumerate linear coefficients at the same quadratic coefficient, and simply adjust the coefficients. And we achieve factorization immediatly. This second step after finding the initial smooth, shouldn't take much time. So the algorithm will be limited by how quickly we find a single smooth. 

I will update the paper with what I found tomorrow and uploaded a PoC shortly after.

Unless microsoft pays my former manager 100 million (because they waited too long the price has gone up) right now, then I might postpone.

Factorization has fallen. Prepare yourselves. Prepare yourselves for the disaster of your own making.
I wanted to sell my work. You chased away buyers and ruined my life, drive me to the brink of hopelessness and despair. 

You all deserve what is coming. Dies Irae. 

The time of reckoning is now.

I will bring the future into this world. And you are either with me, or against me. 
Playtime is over, now we get serious.

ps: The american cryptologic advantage got fucked by a "dude in a dress". Morrons. Tell pete hegseth, military leadership is about strategy. You win wars with strategy. Not by acting like a shit for brains morron. You got outplayed by a "dude in a dress", fucking losers.

pps: Between now and disclosure.. do not try to talk me out of it unless you are willing to pay my former manager 100 million. At this late stage, that is the only way to stop what is going to happen. Every day you people did nothing, the price went up. Now it is at 100 million. The price will be paid, one way or another. And after this, the price will keep going up. And I will break ECC as well. I am very reasonable, but you pushed me to this. Now I don't care anymore. Dies Irae fuckers. Day of wrath is here.
 
pps: I am dead serious. This is not a bluff. I found the solution now. I have no words for what you people did for well over a year. Because any of your cryptologists should have known where this was headed. Yet I was treated this way. This anger cannot be repaired anymore. Not without 100 million on my former manager's bank account. I will succeed at breaking ECC too. And that will be far less funny then this. I don't care. Unlike pete hegseth. I am strong. I am not a cunt. You pay the price or you figure out a way to kill me. That is how this will end now. 

Bah, I'm idling way to much lately. I should wake up tomorrow, push hard for one day, and just finish it. Just find a smooth using regular QS. Enumerate linear coefficients for the quadratic coefficient the smooth was found at modulo the smooth... multiply the coefficients so we generate the same smooth. Which should just be linear congruence and chinese remainder. Easy. I'm going to finish this now.... I'm just tired and depressed man. They have ruined my life. They have ruined the life of one of my best friends simply because he supported me. And for 2 years, nobody did anything. There is no justice in this world. I have to do everything myself. I have to make my own justice. And eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Microsoft ruins my life and that of one of my best friends, now I ruin microsoft. They call it justice. It's justified justice. I don't care what anyone else says. Ofcourse had microsoft paid my manager a million like a year ago, we could have moved on from this. Now they have to pay 100 million or face cryptologic warfare until i'm dead. Total financial collapse? No problem, blame Microsoft. Oops, your nukes are secured with some crappy PKI scheme? No problem, blame Microsoft. Oops, you got fucked by a polar bear? No proble, blame microsoft. I had no choice. I'm not a cunt who is just going to take punches. I have to fight back. I have to get justice for my friends. I will wake up tomorrow and finish this. To get justice.
