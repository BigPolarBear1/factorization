DISCLAIMER: AT NO POINT IN MY 2.5 YEARS OF RESEARCH DID I USE AI OR HAS AI IN ANY WAY HELPED WITH MY RESEARCH. I'M PUTTING THIS HERE BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE WILL ACCUSE ME OF IT. 

Note: I am antifa, leader of the cipherpunk, fuck the FBI department. 

Note2: It's basically done now, the NFS variant is nearing completion soon, nothing novel research wise has to be figured out now. I just need to refactor a few things and I'm done.
I have been unemployed for 2 years. I am looking for work. I would like some way where I can have enough time to attack ECC and DLP next. In addition, for a payment, I can also show people how I appraoched factorization from start to finish. Because the method of how I conduct my research and consistently have success is just as valueable as the research itself. And I follow the same patterns over and over again, no matter what subject matter I attack. I don't have a very high IQ and I'm not especially bright or good at doing numbers in my head. But I have insights into research that help me succeed over and over again. I'm willing to teach people how to do it, as long as it enables me to have the finances to continue doing my research aside from that. Contact: big_polar_bear1@proton.me.

This version is somewhat done, but it doesn't achieve much of an advantage, as the main strength of my work will be the NFS_Variant, which performs NFS with reducible quadratic polynomials<br><br>

Update: Ignore that PoC for now. I did some thinking, and I'm going off on a tangent here. I need to regroup. Tomorrow I'll take some example I'm familiar with, i.e 148^2 = 66^2 mod 4387, and modulo reduce both squares, try to figure out how I would assemble those mod m using linear algebra. There's no point in just trying random stuff. Literally, the only times I made progress with my math is when I stop doing chaotic shit, and just think about the problem for a moment. I know I almost have it... I just need to implement it correctly. 

Update: I was thinking some more.... and the way to do this, if I want to leverage what I learned earlier, doing the whole thing with square multiples of a smooth, aka, finding a square modulo a smooth... the way you would do it with this setup is, you would have your integer side on the left side of your congruence, and then on the right side you find a square modulo your integer side. That is probably how that is supposed to work. I reread the chapter on the quadratic character base in matthew brigg's paper on NFS. And they also seem to be finding a square like this.. I was misinterpreting what NFS did before. This type of setup would thus be most like NFS. Let me first generate some examples where the right side is a square mod the left side, and then adjust the coefficients and take the gcd....I got the be deliberate in my math, not just try random shit, and I need to verify my assumptioms first.

Update: You know, I'm a fucking idiot. In one or two months, I could have studied abstract algebra, and worked through some undergraduate course on youtube and read some books about it... and then I could have read matthew brigg's paper on NFS after that... and I would have probably instantly made all the connections to my own work. Instead I feel like I'm tying to decipher some alien scripture. When this is done... I want to atleast be able to understand and read graduate level books on number theory and abstract algebraa and work through those famous MIT lectures on linear algebra. I'm not going to do any more research until I do this. I am fucking shooting myself in the foot here by just yolo-ing it. I mean... I'm doing it, making progress, no matter how slow... but I think if I keep working like this, I am going to have a mental breakdown because I'm making things way too hard for myself.

So what I was doing with QSv3_find_similar.py last month. Where we would find a smooth, then iterate coefficients that generated multiples of that smooth  until we found a square multiple. That original smooth needs to be represented by the integer side of what I'm doing now... and those multiples by the algebraic side. A setup like that is the only way any of this is ever going to work. I got to be deliberate and focussed in what I do..... so let me start with pen and paper and work out some small toy examples before I implement the code.... fucking hell. Just because I'm almost finished doesn't mean I can drop the ball like this and just do unfocused gibberish... just gotta stay focused for a few days and finish my work the right way.

Update: I think I know how to do it. I.e if N=4387 and we have y0 = 148 and y1 = 66. 148 is divisible for 37, and in our hashmap at z=1 we find a 0 solution mod 37... because 37^2-4387\*4\*1 is a quadratic residue. So if we generate moduli with those 0 solutions and calculate y1 with the roots of the quadratic residues... then things are aligned such that if we find a square mod m... we should be able to adjust the coefficient.  Hmm. I'll give it a try tomorrow. I'm going to take a break today. Just stressed and I need a day to clean up my room because I cant think in this mess.

Update: Yea. So what I was doing in the last few days was to have linear coefficients y0 and y1 be roots of quadratic residues.... but one of them needs to be a 0 solutions (aka, needs to be your modulus) ...else we don't have things aligned such that when we find a square mod m, we can just adjust the coefficients and take the GCD as I had demonstrated last month with QSv3_find_similar.py .... see it helps to just step back for a day, and actually really think about it rather then just mess around with a PoC hoping for things to just work. I'll have a working PoC that does square finding mod m correctly soon... give me a few days. I need to pace myself, after 2.5 years of doing this, I'm mentally exhausted... but I think it's mostly due to unemployment and everything that happened in 2023 and not having seen my friends since. It's very hard to do a long term project like this while under conditions like that.
