One final time before I do what I must, looking for work, big_polar_bear1@proton.me. Cant work for big tech bc of what happened in 2023. Cant travel to the US anymore bc I would get arrested (hence cant work for US companies either). Cant say I didnt try when all the infosec shitheads start pointing fingers again.

Disclaimer: At no point did AI contribute anything to this research project. Copilot can't even calculate basic congruences without making mistakes. People who think AI can do novel math research are delusional.

NOTE: Starting 2026, none of my research will be published. Only people who treat me with respect will be allowed access to my work. And NATO countries/big tech are very low on that list after harassing me for years and treating me like shit. And I garantuee you, I will succeed at finding a polynomial time algorithm. There is no one else alive in this fucking world more determined then me to succeed at this. Fucking losers.


#### To run debug.py" (Prints the linear and quadratic coefficients to solve for 0 in the integers, for use with my paper):</br></br>

To run: python3 debug.py -keysize 12

This basically creates a system of quadratics. Solving them mod p is easy. But there is only one root solution (the factor of N) which solves the system for 0 for any mod p (aka solves it in the integers). Figuring out how to exactly do this quickly is still an ongoing area of research for me. And if a polynomial time algorithm for factorization exists, it is likely done by solving this system of quadratics. Finding a polyomial time algorithm is my ultimate goal, as this would make progress toward solving p = np as well. 

#### To run from folder "CUDA_QS_variant" (WIP):</br></br>
To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run:  python3 run_qs.py -keysize 160 -base 2000 -debug 1 -lin_size 10_000_000 -quad_size 100</br></br>

Prerequisites: </br>
-Python (tested on 3.13)</br>
-Numpy (tested on 1.26.2)</br>
-Sympy</br>
-cupy-cuda13x</br>
-cython</br>
-setuptools</br>
-h5py</br>
(please open an issues here if something doesn't work)</br></br>

Additionally cuda support must be enabled. I did this on wsl2 (easy to setup), since it gets a lot harder to access the GPU on a virtual machine.

Update: Fuck it. I'm just going to do what I tried doing earlier in September. Try to find "similar smooths" .. I could just generate square moduli... use those for sieving.. and try to find odd exponent factors by having them as quadratic coefficient. Now that I understand how this works... this may actually be a feasible idea. 

And its also like.. small factors will always be well represented in smooth candidates.. however... large prime factors are the bottleneck.. so I could just use large prime factors as quadratic coefficient... thats going to then generate smooth candidates with that large prime factor included... I do really like this way of appraoching it... plus if I use square moduli thats additionally going to reduce the amount of odd exponent primes I need to worry about. Bah. Let me give it a try. I dont need to invent any new code for this, its all stuff I've already done in some shape or form in the past.
