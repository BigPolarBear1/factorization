#### To run from folder "QS_variant" (Standard SIQS with our number theory as backend):</br></br>
To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace  (From inside PoC_Files_Find_Similar)</br>
To run: python3 run_qs.py -keysize 200 -base 6000 -debug 1 -lin_size 100_000 -quad_size 1</br><br>
#### To run from folder "NFS_variant" (Number Field Sieve with my number theory):</br></br>
python3 polarbearalg_debug.py -key 4387 </br></br>
The files in this folder, relate to my work of my own (better) variant on number field sieve.</br></br>
polarbearalg_debug.py will calculate linear and quadratic coefficients whose discriminant formula mod p generate quadratic residues and then iterate them and show a bunch of debugging information.
I will finish this algorithm in the coming day. But it showcases the bridge to Number Field Sieve already. In addition see the paper. 

Polarbearalg_debug.py also has highly minimized code compared to some of the earlier code I shared. After 2.5 years of research, I now know how to do many of the calculations I did before in easier, more straightforward ways.




Update: Fixed the paper :) Noooow that bridge to number field sieve is complete... fucking hell... took me long enough. looooool. I am an idiot. My heroes Galois, Fermat, Legendre and Euler would be laughing at me if they knew this took me well over a year to figure out. Good thing they are not here anymore to see this embarassment. I need to quit math for sure after this. I'm just not good at math.
