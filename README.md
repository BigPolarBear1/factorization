DISCLAIMER: AT NO POINT IN MY 2.5 YEARS OF RESEARCH DID I USE AI OR HAS AI IN ANY WAY HELPED WITH MY RESEARCH. I'M PUTTING THIS HERE BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE WILL ACCUSE ME OF IT. 

Note: I am antifa, leader of the cipherpunk, fuck the FBI department. 

Note2: It's basically done now, the NFS variant is nearing completion soon, nothing novel research wise has to be figured out now. I just need to refactor a few things and I'm done.
I have been unemployed for 2 years. I am looking for work. I would like some way where I can have enough time to attack ECC and DLP next. In addition, for a payment, I can also show people how I appraoched factorization from start to finish. Because the method of how I conduct my research and consistently have success is just as valueable as the research itself. And I follow the same patterns over and over again, no matter what subject matter I attack. I don't have a very high IQ and I'm not especially bright or good at doing numbers in my head. But I have insights into research that help me succeed over and over again. I'm willing to teach people how to do it, as long as it enables me to have the finances to continue doing my research aside from that. Contact: big_polar_bear1@proton.me.

#### To run from folder "QS_variant" (Standard SIQS with our number theory as backend):</br></br>
To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run: python3 run_qs.py -keysize 200 -base 6000 -debug 1 -lin_size 100_000 -quad_size 1</br></br>
This version is somewhat done, but it doesn't achieve much of an advantage, as the main strength of my work will be the NFS_Variant, which performs NFS with reducible quadratic polynomials<br><br>
#### To run from folder "Improved_QS_Variant" (Sort of a QS/NFS hybrid that improves on Quadratic Sieve using the number theory I developped):</br></br>

I just uploaded polarbearalg_v35.py</br>
To run: python3 polarbearalg_v35.py -keysize 20</br>

I fixed the PoC..... lol. 
It was actually extremely simple. I was way too overcomplicating everything inside my head.
Its done! MY WORK IS COMPLETE! Check v34, it has the linear algebra working.

Update: in v35 I've replaced the left side with legendre symbols... and it still appears to work. So we do not need to worry about trail factorization of zx^2 at all. Holy fuck. This blows any existing factorization algorithm out of the water. LOL. What a shit day this is going to be for the NSA. HAHAHAAHAHAHAHA.
