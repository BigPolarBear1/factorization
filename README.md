DISCLAIMER: AT NO POINT IN MY 2.5 YEARS OF RESEARCH DID I USE AI OR HAS AI IN ANY WAY HELPED WITH MY RESEARCH. I'M PUTTING THIS HERE BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE WILL ACCUSE ME OF IT. 

Note: Remember, as this now comes to completion in the coming days. Both the FBI and Microsoft knew I was working on factorization when I had only been working on it for a few months and nobody else in the entire world knew I was working on it. I tried desperately to avoid the path of public disclosure as I would have much rather sold my work. But at every turn people made it impossible. This would not have happened 10 years ago. An oppurtunity presented itself, it was literally handed to you on a silver platter.. and instead you people all treated me like shit and gambled on me failing with my project. I ask you, where has your common sense gone? I hate what this will do to everyone around me, this is never what I wanted.

Note: I am antifa, leader of the cipherpunk, fuck the FBI department.

Update: Just run using 120 bit for now. I've preset thresvar_similar to this bitlength. I've also implemented a very simple heuristic to just build a new modulus within range of the bitlength we want for find_similar()... that definitely needs improvement... but its good enough for now. The one big glaring issue now is that I DEFINITELY need to p-adically lift for as long as the roots are within the sieve_interval. Because we really need those outliers with high exponents. Otherwise as the bitlength goes up we have to increase thresvar_similar .. which we need to keep as small as possible... so my next focus will be on this... either today or tomorrow. Lets see.
