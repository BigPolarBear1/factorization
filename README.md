#### To run from folder "QS_variant" (Standard SIQS with our number theory as backend):</br></br>
To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run: python3 run_qs.py -keysize 200 -base 6000 -debug 1 -lin_size 100_000 -quad_size 1</br></br>

See below for an improved way of performing what this PoC does.. I'll delete this Proof of Concept once the PoC for Improved_QS_Variant matures a little more<br><br>
#### To run from folder "NFS_Variant" (Sort of a QS/NFS hybrid that improves on Quadratic Sieve using the number theory I developped):</br></br>

I just uploaded polarbearalg_v37.py</br>
To run: python3 polarbearalg_v37.py -keysize 50</br>

I've ran some test. We don't need to find a square for zx^2 in the integers. As long as zx^2-n is square and zx^2 mod m is square.. I'm still working out the details. Will upload more info soon.
